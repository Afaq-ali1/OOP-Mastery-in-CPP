Welcome to the "OOP Mastery in CPP" repository! In this comprehensive guide, you will learn C ++ from the very basics to becoming a master. This project utilizes the "easy and simple" teaching method to make your learning experience interactive and engaging.



## Introduction

#OOP Mastery in CPP with me
Hello, I'm Afaq Ali , This repository is your gateway from zero to OOP hero. No prior experience required! We'll explore OOP together, making it simple and fun. Are you ready to embark on this journey with me and master OOP from the ground up?

Top 50 OOPs Interview Questions & Answers
1) What is OOPS?
OOPS is abbreviated as Object Oriented Programming system in which programs are considered as a collection of objects. Each object is nothing but an instance of a class.
2) Write basic concepts of OOPS?
Following are the concepts of OOPS:
1. Abstraction
2. Encapsulation
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism
3) What is a class?
A class is simply a representation of a type of object. It is the blueprint/plan/template that describes the details of an object.
>
4) What is an Object?
An object is an instance of a class. It has its own state, behavior, and identity.
5) What is Encapsulation?
Encapsulation is an attribute of an object, and it contains all data which is hidden. That hidden data can be restricted to the members of that class.
Levels are Public, Protected, Private, Internal, and Protected Internal.
6) What is Polymorphism?
Polymorphism is nothing but assigning behavior or value in a subclass to something that was already declared in the main class. Simply, polymorphism takes more than one form.
7) What is Inheritance?
Inheritance is a concept where one class shares the structure and behavior defined in another class. If Inheritance applied to one class is called Single Inheritance, and if it depends on multiple classes, then i, is called multiple Inheritance.

8) What are manipulators?
Manipulators are the functions which can be used in conjunction with the insertion (<<) and extraction (>>) operators on an object. Examples are endl and setw.
9) Explain the term constructor
A constructor is a method used to initialize the state of an object, and it gets invoked at the time of object creation, Rules for constructor are:
• Constructor Name should be the same as a class name.
A constructor must have no return type.
10) Define Destructor?
A destructor is a method which is automatically called when the object is made of scope or destroyed. Destructor name is also same as class name but with the tilde symbol before the name.
11) What is an Inline function?
An inline function is a technique used by the compilers and instructs to insert complete body of the function wherever that function is used in the program source code.
12) What is a virtual function?
A virtual function is a member function of a class, and its functionality can be overridden in its derived class. This function can be implemented by using a keyword called virtual, and it can be given during function declaration,
A virtual function can be declared using a token(virtual) in C++. It can be achieved in C/Python Language by using function pointers or pointers to function.
13) What is a friend function?
A friend function is a friend of a class that is allowed to access to Public, private, or protected data in that same class. If the function is defined outside the class cannot access such information.
A friend can be declared anywhere in the class declaration, and it cannot be affected b access control keywords like private, public, or protected.
